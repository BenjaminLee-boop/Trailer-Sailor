# Trailer-Sailor

### User Story
> AS A consumer of various streaming platforms and films.
> I WANT easy access to trailers and other pertinent information.
> SO THAT I can make a more informed decision about what to watch.

### Acceptance Criteria
> GIVEN I am a user of the Trailer-Sailor App.
> WHEN I type in the name of the movie or show that I might want to watch.
> THEN video of the trailer and metadata regarding the show is generated.

### The Pitch
*Have you ever had a movie night with your significant other, or a group of friends, and no one can agree on what to watch? Not only that, but some of the choices that are being thrown around don't have trailers attached to them in their parent streaming platform. The application we have made, called Trailer-Sailor, will not only play the particular trailer that you are looking for when you click search, but it will also display relevant metadata information about the movie, such as ratings and plot.*
